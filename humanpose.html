                This project presents a simple way to generate a realistic virtual 3D avatar from one single 2D image. 
                This avatar maintains the body details like clothes and hair and accurate body shape proportions. 
                In fact, it is shown how it's possible to infer the original body measurements from the virtual ones. 
              </p>
              <p><img src="https://drlux.github.io/HumanPose/Diapositiva2.jpg" />
                Developed by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, can be considered the state-of-the-art approach 
                for real-time human pose estimation. It allows real-time localization of human body parts, such as the 
                shoulders, elbows, and ankles, from an input image or video.
              </p>

                OpenPose use a bottom up approach, that means that the detection do not start from people detections.
                Instead, it starts from the keypoints detections. The keypoints are detected using a convolution 
                deep neural network that encode the entire image and produce an embedder. Then, another neural network 
                uses this encoder to produce a Part Affinity Field (PAF) that encodes the spatial relationship (location 
                and orientation ) between the human libs. Then this PAF and the initial gloab embedder are used by another 
                neural network to produce a confidence map for the different body parts. At the end of these steps, the model
                is able to identify the differents keypoints on the body but it is still necessary to build the Spanning tree 
                to connect all the joint and build the skeleton. This is done by using the Greedy Bipartite graph algorithm 
                that split the problem in a bipartite matching poblem and than matching the adjacent nodes indepenetly also 
                using the infered PAF.

                This is a general overview of the first version of the general network architecture. We can see how the 
                inference process is an iterative one and the result it's produced after a T number of iterations.
              </p>
              <p><img src="https://drlux.github.io/HumanPose/Diapositiva5.jpg" />
                This is the result of OpenPose applied to my own body.

                SMPL is a method that reconstruct 3D human bodies from one or more RGB images by predicting 
                parameters of a statistical 3D body model.
              </p>
              <p><img src="https://drlux.github.io/HumanPose/Diapositiva7.jpg" />
              </p>
              <p><img src="https://drlux.github.io/HumanPose/Diapositiva8.jpg" />
              </p>
              <p><img src="https://drlux.github.io/HumanPose/Diapositiva9.jpg" />
                Now that we are infered general template shape we have to move human mesh accordingly to a new pose.
                This is called Skinning process.
              </p>
              <p><img src="https://drlux.github.io/HumanPose/Diapositiva10.jpg" />
                Standard skinning methods (based on the linear blend skinning (LBS) method) producess deformation on the 
                final mesh produced.
              </p>
              <p><img src="https://drlux.github.io/HumanPose/Diapositiva11.jpg" />
                SMPL algorithm produces a skinning result by a simple, additive process w.r.t general information learned by data.
              </p>
              <p><img src="https://drlux.github.io/HumanPose/Diapositiva12.jpg" />
                This is the detailed process.
              </p>
              <p><img src="https://drlux.github.io/HumanPose/Diapositiva13.jpg" />
              </p>
              <p><img src="https://drlux.github.io/HumanPose/Diapositiva14.jpg" />
                This is the result of SMPL applied to my own body.
              </p>
              <p><img src="https://drlux.github.io/HumanPose/Diapositiva15.jpg" />
                This work is an evolution of the previous SMPL model. 
                It is able to infer a more accurate body share during the body reconstruction and
                also to infer from it the real body measurements. It can be used to estimate the 
                body size in the image.

                Since it is hard to collect couple of image and relative meshes, the idea behind SHAPY is to 
                enrich the body regressor information with external data like Linguistic Attributes and Anthropometric Measurements.

                The labeled CAESER dataset with linguistic attributes and leanr a Virtual Measurements model and Shape to Attributes model.

              <p><img src="https://drlux.github.io/HumanPose/Diapositiva18.jpg" />
                They add to the dataset new losses from the Virtual Measurements model and Shape to Attributes model.

                This is the result of SHAPY applied to my own body.

                Parametric models like SMPL are able to  create a GENERAL human body but are not able to reproduce specific details like clothes, hair â€¦
                ICON is able to create a detailed surface and also maintain the ability of moving the pose of the created avatar.

                I use a combination of different models like: OpenPose,SMPL,SHAPY and ICON to create an accurate 3D model 
                of my own body from a single 2D image.
              </p>
              <p><img src="https://drlux.github.io/HumanPose/Diapositiva28.jpg" />
                In this last slide I show a comparison of my own body measurements with the ones infered by the models.
